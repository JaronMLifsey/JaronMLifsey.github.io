            This editor allows for 'painting' grass on the terrain which will apply the grass in greater densities the longer painting was done, up to a point at least.
            Grass was layed out in a grid with each instance randomly distributed within it's little box.
            This allowed for consistent results when paining, but prevented an grid-like appearance.
            The grass was broken up into quadrants and only those in view would be rendered.
        </p>

            The grass also responds to wind which was implemented as a 2D texture stretched over the map created with multiple sign waves of varying amplitude, frequency, and direction.

            I had originally wanted to make this editor more versatile, by allowing more than one foliage model per map, but I never got around to that.
            The editor, as I left it, allows for selecting only one model per map.
