            I currently work as a game tester for Experis Game Solutions, but my education and prior job was in software development and I'm looking to return to that in a Junior or Entry Level position.
            I created this portfolio site as a hobby project and to learn a bit about web development.
            Feel free to peruse using the legend on the left to navigate - it's designed to be glanced through.
